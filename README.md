## Project Overview

This Excel project presents an analysis of vehicle crash data, specifically focusing on identifying temporal patterns in accident occurrences over a 24-hour period. The goal was to pinpoint peak crash times to inform strategic planning for traffic management, public safety campaigns, and efficient resource allocation for emergency services.

This project, accessible via SharePoint, demonstrates proficiency in:
*   **Data Preparation & Aggregation:** Utilizing Excel's capabilities to organize and summarize raw incident data.
*   **Data Visualization:** Creating clear and insightful charts to highlight key trends.
*   **Pivot Table Mastery:** Leveraging pivot tables to dynamically group and count data (e.g., crashes by hour).
*   **Data-Driven Insights:** Extracting actionable conclusions from visual and numerical analysis.

## Key Insights from "Crash Times" Analysis

The "Crash Times" worksheet, utilizing a pivot table and a line chart, reveals the following patterns in accident occurrences:

*   **Dual Rush Hour Peaks:** The data clearly shows two significant peaks in crash frequency:
    *   A **morning peak** occurring around **7 AM to 8 AM**, coinciding with morning commutes.
    *   An **afternoon/evening peak** between **3 PM and 6 PM**, aligning with evening rush hour traffic.
*   **Lowest Activity in Early Morning:** The fewest accidents occur during the very early morning hours, specifically from **1 AM to 4 AM**, when traffic volume is at its lowest.
*   **Total Incidents:** The analysis covers a total of **7,879** crash incidents.

These insights are crucial for understanding when and how to best address traffic safety challenges.

## Methodology & Tools

*   **Tool:** Microsoft Excel (accessed via Microsoft 365 / SharePoint)
*   **Techniques Used:**
    *   **Pivot Tables:** For aggregating crash incidents by hour of the day.
    *   **Line Charts:** To visually represent the time-series distribution of crashes over a 24-hour cycle.
    *   **Data Cleaning & Formatting:** (Implied from other sheet names) Preparation of raw data for analysis.

## Excel Workbook Structure

The Excel file is well-organized into several sheets, indicating a comprehensive approach to the accident data analysis:

*   `Requirements`: Outlines the project scope and specific analytical objectives.
*   `Vehicle Crash Data`: Contains the raw or cleaned dataset of vehicle crash incidents.
*   `Crash Times`: The sheet showcased, containing the pivot table and line chart analyzing crash frequency by time of day.
*   `Unique Accident Addresses`: Likely contains analysis related to geographical distribution of accidents.
*   `Total Injured and Dead`: Focuses on the severity of accidents, specifically the number of injuries and fatalities.
*   `Contributing Factors`: Investigates various factors that may lead to accidents (e.g., weather, road conditions, driver behavior).
